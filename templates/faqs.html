    <h2>FAQ's</h2>
    <h4>What is the Bennyapp platform in simple terms, and how can I use it?</h4>
    <p>The Bennyapp platform is a fast, and cost effective way for businesses, associations, groups, and individuals to utilize a mobile app for their audience, without the high development cost.  Although some mobile applications are very specific and sophisticated, many only need a mobile application for the most common functionalities.  Bennyapp provides this and more.  Each of our customer’s mobile app is separate and specific for their use, and all of the data and information contained is separate as well.  Depending upon the user and defined role, you can create contact forms that can be used to send and receive data separately with employees and customers, while storing the results in your separate database.</p>

    <h4>Is The Setup Hard, Do I need Technical Experience?</h4>
    <p>We don’t like to use the word setup, it seems permanent; we prefer configuration.  What’s great about our platform is that it is dynamic, so you have the ability to change any part of the configuration at any time.  Changing users or contact forms at any time after the initial configuration is perfectly fine, and the way the system was intended to be used.  No the configuration is not hard, and you don’t need to be a technical person.  We put a lot of effort behind the design of the user interface to make it as easy as possible.  For those that need assistance on understanding how the system works, we provide detailed instructions and FREE tech support.</p>

    <h4>How Do I Configure Up My Mobile App?</h4>
    <p>After you create an account on the Bennyapp platform, you will be provided a PC access account to configure and manage your mobile app.</p>

    <h4>What Are Users &amp; Roles?</h4>
    <p>Each account on the Bennyapp platform can have one or more than one user.  Users are defined as to who will use and see information and features within the system.</p>

    <h4>Four basic user types:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="sub-title">Super Admin:</span> Owner of the account, and has full rights and privileges.  Usually the business owner, or
    authorized representative with full authority to enter into an agreement with DM Tech
    Solutions, LLC.  Can create multiple admins, admin types, employees, and employee types.</li>
      <li><span class="sub-title">Admin:</span> Created by the super admin, and can create multiple employees and employee types.</li>
      <li><span class="sub-title">Employee:</span> Created by super admin or admin.  Employee cannot create super admin, admin, or other employees.</li>
      <li><span class="sub-title">Customer:</span> There are two channels for customers to join the Bennyapp platform. First, Super admin, admin, or employees can add customers through created customer contact forms.  The second way is for customers to download the Bennyapp, and joins the customer’s mobile app network. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additional users and roles can be created on a case by case basis with customization. </p>

    <h4>How Does The User Role Functionality Work?</h4>
    <p>Based on the user and permissions assigned, users will have certain functionality and features.  For example, you may want to build a store for your mobile app.  Customers will be able to see store products and services, and make purchases whereas, employees may not need to see the store contents.  You may have a form that warehouses in different locations uses to request and intake inventory, customers will not need to see this and won’t be able to because of their defined user role. </p>

    <h4>How Many PC Accounts Come With My Account?</h4>
    <p>PC accounts are automatically created for each user, except for customers.  Upon account creation, a verification link is emailed to the user and they must click to activate.  Like the mobile app, these accounts interface with your specific database and gives you a lot of the functionality that is present on the mobile app.</p>

    <h4>How Is The Bennyapp Downloaded?</h4>
    <p>Your customers can download your mobile app from the IOS and Android by accessing the play stores directly or through the link below.  We recommend that our customers create a link to our download page, because it will contain much more information about the platform, future enhancements, and new release dates that may not be posted on the IOS and Android play stores.  The link to our download page is <a href="http://bennyapp.com/download/">http://bennyapp.com/download/</a>.</p>
    <p>Admins and employees do not download the IOS and Android play stores. These users will receive a link and instructions to our backend download site, because the functionality of the mobile app is different than customers.</p>

    <h4>How Do My Customers See My Business On The Bennyapp?</h4>
    <p>When customers download the Bennyapp, they will join your business network by putting in an ID that is specific to your mobile app or by searching and finding your mobile app in the global directory.  Once joined, you will have direct access to them and they will see your published content.</p>

    <h4>Can Customers Join Multiple Networks?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Customers often do business with many different entities.  If a customer uses more than one Bennyapp customer, they can toggle between them.  The customer’s mobile app will automatically integrate all alerts and time related events from multiple mobile networks into one consolidated view for ease use.</p>

    <h4>Who Pays To Use The Bennyapp And What Does It Costs?</h4>
    <p>The Bennyapp platform has a standard, one subscription level monthly service fee.  Only the account creator (super admin) pays this fee, all other users and user accounts are FREE and included with the standard pricing.  Currently our pricing is $100 per month with a 14 day trial period.</p>

    <h4>Do You Provide Technical Support?</h4>
    <p>Yes, we provide FREE technical support for our current and future customers on the use of the Bennyapp platform, and answer questions related to whether our platform will integrate with your processes.</p>

    <h4>Does The Bennyapp Work In All Countries?</h4>
    <p>Yes, the Bennyapp platform is a global solution.  If there is an internet connection, you can use the Bennyapp.  Currently we offer an English only translation, but we have in development a multi-language solution scheduled to release in January 2016.</p>

    <h4>How Do I Customize Or Add Features?</h4>
    <p>The Bennyapp will be the ultimate solution for some, and a foundational baseline solution for others.  Whenever possible, we make all changes and enhancements to the platform available to all of our customers, but there are times when customization makes sense.  We have in place a discounted consulting fee to scope and build custom modules that integrate with your baseline mobile app.  Our goal is to build a long lasting relationship with you by providing a solution that you will be happy with and use for many years to come.  If you have a question, or would like to discuss additional features and customization; email <a href="mailto:info@dmtechsoltuions.com">info@dmtechsoltuions.com</a>.</p>

    <h4>How Does The Merchant Service Account Work; Is PayPal The Only Option?</h4>
    <p>No!  We recognize that some of our customers have existing merchant accounts, or simply would like a choice.  The issue we faced when designing Bennyapp is that there is just too many merchant service companies to create a scalable solution.  So, what we have done is built in a compromise to cater to those that want to use a non Paypal merchant service company; this would fall under customization and there would be additional one-time costs.  As stated earlier in the section on “How Do I Customize Or Add Features" to your mobile app, our goal is to build a long lasting relationship with you by providing a solution that you will be happy with and use for many years to come.</p>

    <h4>How Many Different Products Can I Have In My Mobile Store?</h4>
    <p>If you have a mobile store, you may have an unlimited number of products.</p>
